# leapMotionOsc



Simple openFrameworks app to read OSC messages from hand tracking device LeapMotion.



Notes:

* I got it working on Windows 11, Of 0.12.1, LeapMotion 1, UltraLeap Gemini (version 6.0.0 of the LeapSDK)
* The OSC sender was written by user [jstep](https://community.troikatronix.com/user/jtsteph), you can get it from [here](https://community.troikatronix.com/topic/9080/ultraleap-motion-2-gemini-to-osc) (although I added it to this repo just in case).
* This example only gets orientation and position of the hands, but you can change the Python script to get all fingers information
